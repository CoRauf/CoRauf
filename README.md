## Hi there 👋

I'm Rauf also known as CoRauf – Web3 Builder & Solidity Auditor in Training

**Smart Contract Developer · Vulnerability Researcher · Web3 Protocol Explorer**

---

## 🧠 Who Am I?

I'm a passionate learner and builder diving deep into the Web3 stack with a strong focus on **smart contract security**, **decentralized systems**, and **gas-efficient development**.

I'm not here to play around with surface-level tutorials. I'm building from scratch, breaking things on purpose, and fixing them better. My toolbox: **Solidity**, **Foundry**, and real protocol logic.

## 🛠️ What I’m Working On

### 🔒 Solidity Vulnerability Lab (w/ Foundry)
- Simulating and testing known vulnerabilities:
  - ✅ Forcefully sending ether.   https://github.com/CoRauf/Forcefully_sending_ether
  - ✅ Denial-of-Service (gas griefing, storage loops). https://github.com/CoRauf/DOS_attack_ETH
  - ✅ Over-flow attack.  https://github.com/CoRauf/OverFlow_attack
  - ✅ tx.origin phishing. https://github.com/CoRauf/Phishing_with_tx.origin
  - ✅ Unsafe `delegatecall`. https://github.com/CoRauf/Unsave_delegatecall
- Patch → Break → Test → Repeat

### 🪙 ERC-20 Permit Gasless Tokens
- Built custom token contract using `EIP-2612`
- Implemented `keccak256`, `abi.encode`, `abi.encodePacked`, and signature recovery
- Fully tested using Foundry

### 🧠 DAO Voting (Custom Logic)
- Complex contract with nested `mapping`, `struct`, `enum`, and interface usage
- Emphasis on storage patterns and access control

##

## 🎯 Current Focus

- 🔍 Learn advanced **smart contract auditing** workflows
- 📦 Understand how real protocols (Uniswap, Aave, Compound) are built and attacked
- ✍️ Build Foundry test suites that simulate and detect vulnerabilities
- 🎓 Work toward launching secure dApps with real-world use cases

## 📫 Contact

I'm always up for connecting with other Web3 devs, auditors-in-training, or curious minds building decentralized systems. If you're into learning by breaking, rebuilding, and mastering the details — we already speak the same language.
